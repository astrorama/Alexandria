\tableofcontents

The Table module provides the means for reading and writing tables from/to
ASCII or FITS files. It provides a set of classes describing a table in the
memory, which constitute its data model, and methods for reading and writing
these classes from/to ASCII and FITS formats. The following sections describe
briefly how to use the module and can be used as a quick-start guide. For more
detailed information refer to the documentation of each individual class and
method in the Table namespace.

\section tabledatamodel Table Data Model

The main class of the Table is the Table class, which represents a table in
memory. It can be seen as a collection of Row%s, with the restriction that
all share the same columns. Each of the columns is defined by its name (which
must be unique, not be empty and not contain whitespace characters) and the
type of its objects. The information of the columns, which can be both
retrieved from the Table object itself or from any of its Row%s, is represented
by the ColumnInfo class. Each cell of a Row is stored in a boost::variant
(redefined as Row::cell_type), so the boost::get method must be used to retrieve
their content. Note that all the Table data model classes are designed to
be immutable (cannot be modified).

\subsection dmexamples Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to create new Table%s from the scratch
and some basic operations on them. To avoid duplication, the following two
lines are assumed for each example:

\code{.cpp}
  #include "Table/Table.h"
  using namespace Euclid::Table;
  using namespace std;
\endcode

Note that the second and third lines are used to make the example code more
readable and they will introduce all the symbols of the Table and std
namespaces, so they must be sparingly used.

\subsubsection createtable Create a Table

This example demonstrates all the necessary steps for creating a Table object.
To be more comprehensible, each step is presented and explained separately.

The first step is to create the ColumnInfo object which describes the columns
of the table:

\code{.cpp}
  vector<ColumnInfo::info_type> info_list {
    ColumnInfo::info_type {"Function", typeid(string)},
    ColumnInfo::info_type {"X", typeid(double)},
    ColumnInfo::info_type {"Y", typeid(double)}
  };
  auto column_info = make_shared<ColumnInfo>(move(info_list));
\endcode

Each column is described by a ColumnInfo::info_type object, which contains the
column name and its type. As can be seen above, our table will have three
columns defined as:

- **Function**: representing the name of a function,
- **X**: an X value and
- **Y**: the Y value calculated using the function

The ColumnInfo object will be shared between the Table and all its Row%s, so it
is stored in a std::shared_ptr. Note that at the construction of 
the ColumnInfo the `info_list` vector is moved because it is not needed anymore.
This is optional (but recommended).

Having the ColumnInfo object from the previous step, we can start creating the
Row%s of the Table. In this step we store the Row%s in a vector, which will
be used later to construct the Table. The Row constructor gets as parameters a
list with its cell values and the shared pointer of the ColumnInfo object. Note
that all the cells are of the type Row::cell_type, which is a boost::variant
specialization allowing for the types  `bool`, `int32_t`, `int64_t`, `float`,
`double` and `std::string`.

The following code is an example of how to construct a Row in a verbose and
easy way to understand, by first creating a vector with the cell values. Note
that this vector is not going to be further used, so it is moved during the Row
construction.

\code{.cpp}
  vector<Row::cell_type> cell_values {string{"example"}, 5., 2E-15};
  Row row {std::move(cell_values), column_info};
\endcode

Because the Row::cell_type is a boost::variant, extra care must be taken so
each cell value is of the correct type (as defined in the ColumnInfo). If
a cell has incorrect type, a runtime exception will be thrown during the Row
construction. This problem becomes more apparent when literals are used, as
their types might be different than what the user expects. The following table
gives some examples of types and literals, and can be used to avoid mistakes.

| Type          | Literal           | Comment                                                              |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `char*`       | `"text"`          | String literals are C-strings, **do not use!**                       |
| `std::string` | `string{"text"}`  | Explicit string construction is necessary                            |
| `int32_t`     | `int32_t{5}`      | Recommended `int32_t` literal syntax                                 |
| `int64_t`     | `int64_t{5}`      | Recommended `int64_t` literal syntax                                 |
| `int`         |                   | `int32_t` in most cases                                              |
| `long`        |                   | `int32_t` or `int64_t`, OS dependent, **do not use!**                |
| `long long`   |                   | `int64_t` or `int128`, OS dependent, **do not use!**                 |
|               | `5`               | First of `int`, `long`, `long long` which can represent it           |
|               | `5L`              | First of `long`, `long long` which can represent it, **do not use!** |
|               | `5LL`             | `long long`, **do not use!**                                         |
| `float`       | `5.F` or `2E-15F` | Recommended `float` literal syntax                                   |
| `double`      | `5.` or `2E-15`   | Recommended `double` literal syntax                                  |
| `long double` | `5.L` or `2E-15L` | **do not use!**                                                      |

A more complicated and realistic Row creation example is the following, which
creates some Row%s with the results of the `sin` and `cos` functions. Note that
in this example the Row and the vector containing the cell values are
constructed at the same time.

\code{.cpp}
  vector<Row> row_list {};
  for (int i = 0; i <= 5; ++i) {
    double x = i * M_PI / 5;
    row_list.push_back(Row{{string{"sin"}, x, sin(x)}, column_info});
    row_list.push_back(Row{{string{"cos"}, x, cos(x)}, column_info});
  }
\endcode

The final step is to create the Table object itself. The constructor of the
Table takes only one argument, which is the vector of its Row%s. At the moment
there is no support of heterogeneous Table%s, which means that all the Row%s
of a Table must have the same ColumnInfo (an exception is thrown otherwise).

\code{.cpp}
  Table table {row_list};
\endcode

\subsubsection examinecolumn Examine column information

This example shows how the information of the columns can be retrieved by using
the ColumnInfo class. A shared pointer to the ColumnInfo object can be
retrieved either from a Table object or from a Row.

\code{.cpp}
  auto table_column_info = table.getColumnInfo();
  auto row_column_info = row.getColumnInfo();
\endcode

The ColumnInfo object provides the methods ColumnInfo::getName() and
ColumnInfo::getType(), which can be used for retrieving the information of a
specific column by using its index. The total number of columns can be
retrieved by the ColumnInfo::size() method. The following code uses these
methods to print the information of all the columns:

\code{.cpp}
  size_t column_no = table_column_info->size();
  cout << "The table has " << column_no << " columns\n";
  for (size_t i = 0; i < column_no; ++i) {
    cout << "Column " << i << ": "<< table_column_info->getName(i)
         << " (type: " << table_column_info->getType(i).name() << ")\n";
  }
\endcode

Output:

\code
The table has 3 columns
Column 0: Function (type: Ss)
Column 1: X (type: d)
Column 2: Y (type: d)
\endcode

If the index of a column is not known it can be found by using the method
ColumnInfo::find(). This method returns a `unique_ptr<size_t>` which contains
a pointer to the index of the column if it was found, or the `nullptr` if no
column with the given name exists. This facilitates the checking if a column
exists or not, as demonstrated in the following example:

\code{.cpp}
  auto x_index = table_column_info->find("X");
  if (x_index) {
    cout << "Column X has index " << *x_index << "\n";
  } else {
    cout << "Column X not found\n";
  }
  auto z_index = table_column_info->find("Z");
  if (z_index) {
    cout << "Column Z has index " << *z_index << "\n";
  } else {
    cout << "Column Z not found\n";
  }
\endcode

Output:

\code
Column X has index 1
Column Z not found
\endcode

Because all the cell values are stored as boost::variants, if a Table contains
columns of a different type than the one the program expects, the problem will
not be detected until a cell value is retrieved during runtime. For this
reason, to minimize the debugging effort and to allow better log messages,
it is recommended to always check the types of the Table columns in interest,
before trying to read the data from the Row%s cells. This can easily be done
by using the `typeid()` method: 

\code{.cpp}
  if (table_column_info->getType(*x_index) == typeid(double)) {
    // Here is safe to access the X column data
  }
\endcode

\subsubsection accessdata Access the table data

The easiest way to access the data of a Table is by using the iterators
provided by the Table and Row classes. The Table::begin() method provides an
iterator which can be used to iterate through all the Row%s of the table and
the Row::begin() method provides an iterator which can be used to iterate
through all the cells of the Row. Note that each cell of the Row is of the
type `boost::variant`, so if a specific type is not required it can be used
directly. The following lines of code demonstrate how to print on the screen
all the contents of a table, by using these iterators:

\code{.cpp}
  for (auto& row : table) {
    for (auto& cell : row) {
      cout << cell << " ";
    }
    cout << "\n";
  }
\endcode

Output:

\code
sin 0 0 
cos 0 1 
sin 0.628319 0.587785 
cos 0.628319 0.809017 
sin 1.25664 0.951057 
cos 1.25664 0.309017 
sin 1.88496 0.951057 
cos 1.88496 -0.309017 
sin 2.51327 0.587785 
cos 2.51327 -0.809017 
sin 3.14159 1.22465e-16 
cos 3.14159 -1
\endcode

Except of the iterators, the Table and Row classes provide also indexed access
to their contents. The syntax is similar to the STL containers, but a range
check does take place:

\code{.cpp}
  cout << "Third rows X value is " << table[2][*x_index] << "\n";
\endcode

Output:

\code
Third rows X value is 0.628319
\endcode

The Row class, in addition to the indexed access, provides a *map-like*
access based on the name of the column. Note though that this way of accessing
the Row cells implies a **performance penalty** and should be used sparingly.

\code{.cpp}
  cout << "Third rows Y value is " << table[2]["Y"] << "\n";
\endcode

Output:

\code
Third rows Y value is 0.587785
\endcode

Most of the time, to use the data of the Table cells, they must be retrieved with
the correct type. The Row::cell_type objects can be converted to the actual
type by using the `boost::get` method. Note that trying to convert the cell
value to a wrong type will result to a `boost::bad_get` exception. For example,
the following lines of code calculate the sum of the Y column values 
(column of `double` type): 

\code{.cpp}
  double sum {0};
  for (auto& row : table) {
    sum += boost::get<double>(row["Y"]);
  }
  cout << "Sum of all Y values is " << sum << "\n";
\endcode

Output:

\code
Sum of all Y values is 3.07768
\endcode


\section tableio Table I/O

The Table module provides functionality for importing and exporting Table%s
from/to files. The currently supported formats are ASCII space separated text
files and FITS tables. The following examples demonstrate this functionality.

\subsection readascii Reading a Table from an ASCII stream

The Table module provides the class AsciiReader, which can be used for
reading a table from an input stream. Note that a generic `std::istream` is used
instead of a file name. This is done to provide more flexibility. To open a file
as a stream the following code can be used:

\code{.cpp}
  fstream in_stream {"/path/to/table/file"};
\endcode

The AsciiReader class, by default will interpret the `#` as comment character
and will try to detect automatically the names and the types of the columns
in the file. The column names are extracted from the first non empty comment
line, which contains the same number of words as the
number of data columns in the file. If there is no such comment line, the
columns are named as `col1`, `col2`, etc (starting from 1). The types of the
columns are extracted from the second such line, by using the following
conventions:

- bool, boolean : A boolean value as the following (case is ignored):
                  - true,  t, yes, y, 1
                  - false, f,  no, n, 0
- int,  int32   : A 32 bit integer
- long, int64   : A 64 bit integer
- float         : Single (32 bit) precision floating point
- double        : Double (64 bit) precision floating point
- string        : String without whitespaces

If there is no line describing the types of the columns, all the types are
assumed to be strings.

Reading a file that follows the above rules is straight forward. For example,
if a file contains the following text:

\code
# Function        X           Y
#   string   double      double

       sin        0           0
       cos        0           1
       sin 0.628319    0.587785
       cos 0.628319    0.809017
       sin  1.25664    0.951057
       cos  1.25664    0.309017
       sin  1.88496    0.951057
       cos  1.88496   -0.309017
       sin  2.51327    0.587785
       cos  2.51327   -0.809017
       sin  3.14159 1.22465e-16
       cos  3.14159          -1
\endcode

it can be read directly by using the command:

\code{.cpp}
  table = AsciiReader{}.read(in_stream);
\endcode

Note that the above command will read till the end of the stream, so any further
reading attempts will behave like reading an empty file. For the following
examples to work, before calling the read method again, the stream must be
reopened, or be rewind at the beginning by using the commands:

\code{.cpp}
  in_stream.clear();
  in_stream.seekg(0, ios_base::beg);
\endcode

Except of this automatic mode, the AsciiReader class can be parameterized by
passing arguments to its constructor, so it can read files which do not follow
the default conventions. The first constructor parameter can override the
types of the columns. This is very useful for the cases that a program wants
to read the column in a different type (for example read a `float` column as
a `double` column), but also for the cases that a file does not contain the
column types and the program does not want to read them as strings. As an
example, the following code will read the previous file interpreting the X
and Y columns as `float` values:

\code{.cpp}
  vector<std::type_index> column_types {
    typeid(string), typeid(float), typeid(float)
  };
  AsciiReader reader_types {column_types};
  table = reader_types.read(in_stream);
\endcode

Note that the above code will still detect automatically the names of the
columns. If the program wants to override the column names, it can use the
second AsciiReader constructor parameter, which is a vector of strings with
the new column names. The following code will read our table file by reading
the *X* column as *Angle* and the *Y* column as *Value*:

\code{.cpp}
  vector<string> column_names {"Function", "Angle", "Value"};
  AsciiReader reader_names {{}, column_names};
  table = reader_names.read(in_stream);
\endcode

Note that an empty vector is given as the first parameter (the column types).
This will enable automatic detection for the column types. This is true also
for the column names parameter and can be used in the case automatic detection
is desired, but a later parameter must be specified.

The last way the AsciiReader can be parameterized is the comment character. In
fact, any string can be used as a comment indicator and not only a single
character. The comment indicator is set with the third constructor parameter.
The following example can read files which start their comments with the `//`
sequence (column names and types will be detected automatically):

\code{.cpp}
  AsciiReader reader_comment {{}, {}, "//"};
  table = reader_comment.read(in_stream);
\endcode

\subsection writeascii Writing a Table in an ASCII stream

To export a Table as an ASCII character sequence, the Table module provides
the AsciiWriter class. Similarly with the AsciiReader, the AsciiWriter writes
the table in a generic std:ostream instead of a file, to provide more
flexibility. If the table should be exported in a file, a file stream can be
opened using the following code:

\code{.cpp}
  ofstream file_stream {"/path/to/table/file"};
\endcode

By default, the AsciiWriter will use as a comment indicator the `#` character,
it will add the column name and type lines and it will right-align all the
columns. The width of the columns will be automatically calculated based on the
contents of the table cells. For example, the following code will print on the
screen our table:

\code{.cpp}
  AsciiWriter{}.write(cout, table);
\endcode

Output:

\code
# Function        X           Y
#   string   double      double

       sin        0           0
       cos        0           1
       sin 0.628319    0.587785
       cos 0.628319    0.809017
       sin  1.25664    0.951057
       cos  1.25664    0.309017
       sin  1.88496    0.951057
       cos  1.88496   -0.309017
       sin  2.51327    0.587785
       cos  2.51327   -0.809017
       sin  3.14159 1.22465e-16
       cos  3.14159          -1
\endcode

Printing a table on the screen this way can be very handy, especially during
development. Be careful though, because printing a table with hundreds of
thousands of lines in the `std::cout` will actually print all of them.

Similarly with the AsciiReader, the AsciiWriter can be parameterized by
passing arguments to its constructor. Currently, the only option which can be
parameterized is the comment character to use. For example, the following
code will use the `//` comment indicator:

\code{.cpp}
  AsciiWriter writer_comment {"//"};
  writer_comment.write(cout, table);
\endcode

Output:

\code
// Function        X           Y
//   string   double      double

        sin        0           0
        cos        0           1
        sin 0.628319    0.587785
        cos 0.628319    0.809017
        sin  1.25664    0.951057
        cos  1.25664    0.309017
        sin  1.88496    0.951057
        cos  1.88496   -0.309017
        sin  2.51327    0.587785
        cos  2.51327   -0.809017
        sin  3.14159 1.22465e-16
        cos  3.14159          -1
\endcode

\subsection readfits Reading a Table from a FITS file

The Table functionality related with reading a Table from a FITS file is
provided by the FitsReader class. This class can read Table%s from
`CCfits::HDU` objects which contain either ASCII or binary tables. Note that
the input of the FitsReader is the HDU object, so the user has the flexibility
to handle multiple extension HDUs from the same file. An extension can be
retrieved the standard CCfits way, using the following code:

\code{.cpp}
  CCfits::FITS fits {"/path/to/FITS/file"};
  auto& table_hdu = fits.extension(1);
\endcode

In the above code note that the `table_hdu` is a reference. This is obligatory
because the result of the `extension()` method is a sublcass of the
`CCfits::HDU`.

Having the reference of the table HDU, using the FitsReader class to convert
it to a Table object is straight forward. The column names and types will
automatically be detected from the HDU keywords, so reading the Table is as
simple as:

\code{.cpp}
  auto table = FitsReader{}.read(table_hdu);
\endcode

Similarly with the AsciiReader, the FitsReader can be parameterized via its
constructor arguments. In particular, the names of the columns can be
overridden:

\code{.cpp}
  vector<string> column_names {"Function", "Angle", "Value"};
  FitsReader reader {column_names};
  auto table = reader.read(table_hdu);
\endcode

Overriding the column types is not. The conventions of the FITS
types conversions to the Table cell values can be found in the documentation
of the FitsReader::read() method.

\subsection writefits Writing a Table in a FITS file

To export a Table in a FITS file, the Table module provides the FitsWriter
class. This class can append to a `CCfits::FITS` object both ASCII and binary
table HDUs. Note that the `CCfits::FITS` object must be opened in write mode:

\code{.cpp}
  CCfits::FITS fits {"/path/to/FITS/file", CCfits::RWmode::Write};
\endcode

Note that the above command, if the FITS file already exists, will open it
in append mode (the tables will be added after the existing HDUs). To override
an existing FITS file the path has to be prefixed with the '!' character:

\code{.cpp}
  CCfits::FITS fits {"!/path/to/FITS/file", CCfits::RWmode::Write};
\endcode

Having the `fits` object, appending table HDUs is straight forward. The format
of the HDU is set as the FitsWriter constructor parameter (the options are
FitsWriter::Format::BINARY and FitsWriter::Format::ASCII) and the
FitsWriter::write() method gets as parameters the `CCfits:FITS` object to
append the table on, the new HDUs name and the table with the data:

\code{.cpp}
  FitsWriter writer {FitsWriter::Format::BINARY};
  writer.write(fits, "TABLE_NAME", table);
\endcode
